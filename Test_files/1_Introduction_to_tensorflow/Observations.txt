Observed for accuracy of the prediction 
1. more data in the data set leads to more acuaracy. but for some reason, the 20th input started giving an unpredictable error.
So the data set is limited to 19 elements 

2. more cycles give better results 

3. having anomalies in the data set impacts the accuracy of the prediction
